Chess.com Data Analysis Project

Motivation

  Chess is not just a game; it's a fascinating mix of strategy, logic, and human decision-making. With the rise of online platforms like Chess.com, chess players can now access detailed data about their games, including move sequences, opponent ratings, and game results. This project aims to leverage this data to gain insights into chess performance, understand decision-making patterns, and explore areas for improvement.
  
  The ability to analyze game data systematically can help players improve their gameplay, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and even predict outcomes based on prior performance.

Main Research Questions

This project seeks to answer the following key research questions:

  Performance Trends:
    How has the player’s performance (ratings) evolved over time in different game formats (e.g., blitz, rapid, bullet)?
    Are there noticeable periods of improvement or stagnation?
  Move Patterns:
    What are the common opening moves played by the user, and how successful are they?
  Game Outcomes:
    What factors (e.g., opponent rating, time class, move quality) most influence game outcomes (win/loss/draw)?
    Are there specific openings or strategies that correlate with higher win rates?
  Time Management:
    How does time management affect the quality of moves and the final outcome of the game?
    Are there patterns in the time spent per move, especially in critical positions? (Right now, I do not know to how to label a position as critical, maybe I can use some chess engines but It's highly unlikely.)
  Opponent Analysis:
    How does the player perform against higher-rated or lower-rated opponents?
    Is there a rating threshold where performance significantly drops or improves?

Data Source
  The dataset will be obtained directly from Chess.com using their public API. The API provides detailed information about a player’s games, including move sequences, ratings, and metadata.

Project Goals

This project aims to:

  Extract meaningful insights from the player's chess data.
  Visualize trends in performance, move quality, and time management.
  Provide actionable recommendations to improve chess gameplay.
  Explore the potential of machine learning for predicting game outcomes and identifying patterns.
