## Chess.com Data Analysis Project

### Motivation

With the growth of online platforms like Chess.com, players now have access to detailed data about their games, including move sequences, opponent ratings, and game results. This project aims to harness this data to:

- Gain insights into chess performance.
- Understand decision-making patterns.
- Explore areas for improvement.

The systematic analysis of game data can empower players (myself hopefully) to enhance their gameplay, identify strengths and weaknesses, and even predict outcomes based on prior performance.

### Main Research Questions

This project aims to address the following key research questions:

#### 1. Performance Trends:
- How has the player’s performance (ratings) evolved over time in different game formats (e.g., blitz, rapid, bullet)?
- Are there noticeable periods of improvement or stagnation?

#### 2. Move Patterns:
- What are the common opening moves played by the user, and how successful are they?

#### 3. Game Outcomes:
- What factors (e.g., opponent rating, time class, move quality) most influence game outcomes (win/loss/draw)?
- Are there specific openings or strategies that correlate with higher win rates?

#### 4. Time Management:
- How does time management affect the quality of moves and the final outcome of the game?
- Are there patterns in the time spent per move, especially in critical positions?

(*Note: Labeling a position as "critical" may require the use of chess engines, but right now I do not know how can I do this so probably I will not do it.*)

#### 5. Opponent Analysis:
- How does the player perform against higher-rated or lower-rated opponents?
- Is there a rating threshold where performance significantly drops or improves?

### Data Source

The dataset for this project will be obtained directly from Chess.com using their public API. The API provides detailed information about a player’s games, including:

- **Move Sequences**: Full game moves in Portable Game Notation (PGN).
- **Ratings**: Ratings of both players at the time of the game.
- **Metadata**: Game results, timestamps, and time control formats.

**Example Data:**

### Project Goals

The objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Extract Insights**:
   - Analyze the player’s game data to uncover trends and patterns.

2. **Visualize Trends**:
   - Create visual representations of performance, move quality, and time management.

3. **Provide Recommendations**:
   - Offer actionable suggestions to help the player improve their gameplay.

4. **Explore Machine Learning**:
   - Use predictive modeling to identify factors that influence game outcomes and decision-making patterns.
