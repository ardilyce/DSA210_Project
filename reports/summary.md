## Introduction
This project leverages data science and machine learning to analyze my chess gameplay and predict outcomes based on specific patterns. The insights from this project aim to improve my gameplay and decision-making.

---

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze trends in my gameplay across various chess formats.
- To understand the effectiveness of different chess openings.
- To evaluate the impact of time management on game outcomes.
- To predict game outcomes using machine learning models based on specific features such as opening moves and player ratings.

---

## Data Preparation
The dataset used in this project was obtained from my **Chess.com profile**, containing details of games I played, such as:
- **Player Ratings** (White and Black).
- **Time Class**: Bullet, Blitz, and Rapid.
- **Main Opening**: The opening name and sequence used.
- **Result**: Win, Draw, or Loss.

### Steps:
1. The raw data was cleaned and processed to extract relevant features.
2. Derived additional features such as **Rating Differential** and encoded categorical variables (e.g., openings).
3. Stored processed data in `data/processed/ardil30_games.json`.

## Visual Analysis

### Rating Trends Across Time Classes
**Objective:** Visualize how my rating changed over time across Bullet, Blitz, and Rapid formats.

**Insight:** Ratings in Blitz games showed the most consistency, while Bullet ratings fluctuated more significantly.

**Output:**  
A line graph was plotted to showcase the trends, saved as `ml/figures/rating_trends.png`.

---

### Opening Win Percentages
**Objective:** Analyze the win rates of different openings and identify the most effective ones.

**Insight:**  
Certain openings, like the **Sicilian Defense**, had a significantly higher win percentage, while others, like **King's Gambit**, were less effective for my playstyle.

**Output:**  
A bar chart showing win percentages for each opening was saved as `ml/figures/opening_effectiveness_bar_chart.png`.

---

### Time Management Analysis
**Objective:** Assess the impact of time management on gameplay by comparing moves made under different time pressures.

**Insight:**  
Games where more time was spent on critical moves correlated positively with better outcomes. Blitz games often had the most time-pressure-induced mistakes.

**Output:**  
The visualization was saved as `ml/figures/time_management_analysis.png`.

## Machine Learning Models

### Opening Effectiveness Analysis
**Objective:** Train a machine learning model to predict game outcomes based on the **opening** used and other related features.

**Model:** A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained on features including:
- **White Rating**, **Black Rating**, **Time Class**, and **Main Opening**.
- Added feature: **Rating Differential**.

**Result:**  
Achieved an accuracy of **60%** on the test set, with a classification report generated for evaluation.

**Output:**  
The model was saved as `ml/models/opening_analysis_model.pkl`.

---

### Game Outcome Prediction
**Objective:** Predict game outcomes using features such as:
- **First 10 moves**, **Player Ratings**, and **Time Class**.

**Model:**  
Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** using the above features and applied **SMOTE** for handling class imbalances.

**Result:**  
Achieved an accuracy of **59%** on the test set.

**Output:**  
The model was saved as `ml/models/game_outcome_predictor.pkl`.  

A confusion matrix was plotted and saved as `ml/figures/confusion_matrix.png`.

---

## Challenges Faced
- **Class Imbalance:** Draws were underrepresented in the dataset, which affected the model's ability to predict this class accurately.
- **Data Quality:** Some games had incomplete information or were formatted inconsistently, requiring extensive preprocessing.
- **Model Interpretability:** Random Forest models, though effective, posed challenges in explaining specific predictions.

---

## Future Work
To further enhance this project:
1. **Explore Deep Learning Models:** Use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze sequential data like move orders.
2. **Incorporate Opponent Data:** Analyze how opponents' strategies influence game outcomes.
3. **Expand Dataset:** Include more games to improve model generalizability.
4. **Interactive Dashboard:** Build a dashboard to visualize insights dynamically.

---

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into my chess gameplay. From understanding the effectiveness of different openings to predicting outcomes based on various features, the analyses revealed patterns that can help refine my strategies.

**Takeaways:**
- **Opening Analysis:** Identified strengths and weaknesses in my repertoire.
- **Game Outcome Prediction:** Showed promising results, though further improvement is needed.

This project highlights the power of combining data science with gameplay to achieve meaningful insights.
